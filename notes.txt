============

    -> Write Code : Instructing what task to perform 
    
    -> Compilation : Convert Source Code To Intermediate Byte Code (.class file) (It will verify Syntax)

        -> Syntax : Rules / Guidelines 

            -> Every Java File must start with (class, interface, enum, or record expected)

                -> class is must for beginner level
                -> proper method declaration should be given (main method is starting point of a program) 
                -> main method declaration/signature :
                    public static void main(String [] args) {

                    } 

                    -> public : access modifier (visibility control)
                    -> static : keyword that says no need of object to perform operation 
                    -> void : keyword that says we will not return anything (void means nothing)
                    -> main : method name 
                    -> String : data type for text kind of data 
                    -> [] : Array data 
                    -> args : arguments 

                -> ; indicates end of statement 

                -> text data in java is represented using "text"

                -> cannot find symbol : print

                -> NOTE : You want to print in java then use following Syntax
                            System.out.println("Welcome")


        -> javac (Java Compiler) : utility / tool which is part of JDK installation

        -> To peform Compilation : javac App.java 

            -> App.java 

                print(Welcome)

            -> After Compilation : App.class (Byte Code)

                -> error: class, interface, enum, or record expected

                    class Hello {
                        print(Welcome)
                    }

                ->  error: invalid method declaration

                            print(Welcome);
                        }
                    }

                            print(Welcome);
                                ^
                    symbol:   variable Welcome
                
                -> Print data of type text 

                    -> text data in java is represented using "text"

                    class Hello {
                        public static void main(String [] args) {
                            print("Welcome");
                        }
                    }
                
                -> error: cannot find symbol
                        print

                        class Hello {
                            public static void main(String [] args) {

                            }
                        }

            -> NOTE : Success (output is Hello.class file)

                -> The file is not displayed in the text editor 
                because it is either binary or uses an unsupported text encoding.

            -> java(jvm java virtual machine will be invoked) is the command we use to interpret byte code

                -> Syntax : java ClassName 

        -> Any Java Programming

                                                            javac        no issues

-> JVM - JRE - JDK

    -> JVM : Java Virtual Machine 

        -> Virtual Machine : Logical Machine inside a physical machine

        -> Role : Convert Byte Code To Machine Code 

    -> JRE : Java Runtime Environment 

        -> Runtime : Provide required infrstructure to operate the programs

        -> JRE it includes JVM

        -> JRE is needed to run java applications (so no javac)
        
        -> NOTE : End User needs JRE to run the Java Application

    -> JDK : Java Development Kit

        -> Provides Tools Needed for Application Development (javac & java)

        -> As a developer you'll be installing JDK

        -> JDK includes JRE also JVM as part of JRE 

        -> JDK : Allows Developers to Write Code, Compile Code & Run Code


-> Variables : A variable is name of memory(RAM) location, which is used to store data

    -> Variables Allow you to

        -> Assign Data (Value)
        -> Retrieve Data
        -> Manipulate Data (If Required)

    -> Syntax 

        datatype variable_name = value;

        datatype -> classification of data (numbers, decimals, text etc)
        variable_name -> label (like box example)
        = -> assignment operator
        value -> 1000(price), 3.5(rating), "Nike"(brand)

    -> NOTE : // used for comment, this line will be ignored

    -> If you want to store any data, defining data type is must and also 
        datatype should be appropriate type based on value being stored

        -> if you have whole numbers, then datatype is int 
        -> if you have decimal numbers, then datatype is double
        -> if you have text data, then datatype is String
            -> Strings should be enclosed in "value"
